            For Sugar Syrup:\n
            1.	Prepare the Syrup: In a large pan, combine sugar and water. Heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens.\n
            2.	Add Flavorings: Add cardamom powder, rose water, and saffron strands if using. Mix well and keep the syrup warm.\n
            For Gulab Jamun:\n
            1.	Prepare the Dough: In a mixing bowl, combine grated khoya, crumbled paneer, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and cardamom powder. Mix well.\n
            2.	Add Milk: Gradually add milk to the mixture and knead it into a smooth, soft dough. The dough should be pliable and not too sticky.\n
            3.	Shape the Dough: Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface, as this will help them fry evenly.\n
            4.	Heat the Oil: Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.\n
            5.	Fry the Balls: Gently slide the dough balls into the hot oil. Fry them on low heat, stirring gently to ensure even cooking, until they turn golden brown. This may take around 7-8 minutes.\n
            6.	Drain and Soak: Remove the fried gulab jamuns from the oil and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil. Immediately transfer them to the warm sugar syrup.\n
            7.	Soak and Serve: Let the gulab jamuns soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours before serving. This allows them to absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy.\n

        	Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring continuously. The milk will curdle, and the whey will separate.\n
        	Turn off the heat and let it sit for a minute. Then, strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or a fine sieve. Rinse the paneer under cold running water to remove any lemon or vinegar taste.\n
        	Squeeze out the excess water from the paneer and hang it or press it under a heavy object for about 30 minutes to remove any remaining whey.\n
            2.	Preparing Paneer Balls:\n
        	Knead the drained paneer for 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and soft.\n
        	Divide the paneer into small, equal-sized balls and flatten them slightly to form discs.\n
            3.	Cooking Paneer Balls:\n

        	Gently add the paneer discs to the boiling syrup. Cover and cook on medium heat for 15-20 minutes until the paneer discs double in size.\n
        	Remove the pan from heat and let the paneer discs cool in the syrup. Once cooled, gently squeeze out the excess syrup from the paneer discs and set them aside.\n
            4.	Preparing Rabri:\n
        	In another heavy-bottomed pan, boil 1 liter of milk over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the milk thickens to about half its original volume. Stir frequently to prevent burning.\n
        	Add 1/2 cup of sugar, cardamom powder, saffron milk, and chopped nuts. Simmer for another 5-7 minutes until the sugar dissolves completely and the rabri is thick and creamy.\n
        	Add rose water or kewra water, if using, and mix well. Turn off the heat and let the rabri cool to room temperature.\n
            5.	Assembling Rasmalai:\n
        	Gently add the cooked paneer discs to the cooled rabri. Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, in the refrigerator to absorb the flavors.\n
            6.	Serving:\n
        	Serve chilled Rasmalai, garnished with additional chopped nuts and a few saffron strands.\n"""
